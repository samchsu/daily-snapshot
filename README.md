# Daily Snapshot

This project utilizes MERN Stack to create a blog site that allows logged-in users to create, read, update, and delete posts. 
These posts can be a picture with caption, or simply words describing anything. The user, once registered, can change their profile picture, email info, and more. All user information is stored in MongoDB and passwords are hashed to remain confidential. 

The website is deployed using Heroku, accessible through this link: [Daily Snapshot](https://daily-snapshot.herokuapp.com/).
